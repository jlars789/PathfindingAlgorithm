<h1> Pathfinding Algorithm </h1>

<p> An unfinished project from NOVA's STEAM Club. Cut short by COVID-19 </p>

<h3> Original Goal </h3>

<p> This project set out to experiment and research various pathfinding algorithms to use to create a self-driving drone, which was proposed to be either a 
4-wheeled vehicle or a flying drone. Both would be small scale. </p>

<h3> Methodology </h3>

<p> Because generating a pixel environment (square based) is very easy, the goal was to create an obstacle course using seeded, randomly generated courses, where an
object can only move on ground not covered by an obstacle. The objective was to reach the end goal. </p>

<p> To test individual algorithms, each was to be loaded into a testing suite and run against a large number of pre-seeded courses (to ensure fairness) and compare
the results (success, time, and moves made) with others. The tests could be easily generated again to further ensure fairness. </p>
