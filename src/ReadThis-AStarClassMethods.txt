List of all the methods than can be used

Initialization
-AStarPathFinding();
-AStarPathFinding(sizex,sizey,startlocation,targetlocation);
-AStarPathFinding(obstaclemap,startlocation,targetlocation);

Setup
-SetStart(start location (int[]))
-SetTarget(target location (int[]))
-GiveCourseFull(an omnipresent version of the course (int[][]))
-GiveCourse(a course likely not fully mapped for obstacles (int[][]))
-SetParent() - will set up parent array if Startloc, area and path arrays have been initialized

Runtime
-run() -will run the program step by step or all the way through depending on if it is omnipresent
-getpath() -will return a pathnode arraylist with all the steps in sequential order up until the current iteration
-ApplyLocalObstacles(local obstacles in an arraylist) - will apply the local obstacles to the path array
-fillBuffer() -will make all obstacles larger to avoid bumping into them (would reccomend this only for environments with all obstacles mapped)
-clearAllReset()  -clears path and area array and resets location to start;
